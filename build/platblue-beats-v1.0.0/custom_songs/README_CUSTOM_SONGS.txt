Put custom songs here

!! Having a lot custom songs will drastically increase game starting time !!

How to make your own custom song (using in-game tool):
- Open the game and go to Tools>Create custom song
- Fill every info, select song cover and .ogg song (or else game will crash)
NOTE: Existing songs info can only be edited by modifying its files, adding song creator too.
- Go to song selection, go to your song and press F7 to enter the map editor

Files that NEED to be in custom song folder in order to work:
cover.png - Song cover image displayed in song selection menu
info.ini - Info about song, like: name, difficulty and more
song.ogg - Song file itself
map.bin - Map created in in-game editor


REMEMBER: Custom song folder name should not have any spaces or special characters other then - _
